### Growth Mindset

To me, growth mindset is about being able to take a step back and find a different perspective in order to see challenges as exciting opportunities to learn. 

- Lean on teammates to find the best opportunities for collaboration
- Don't get too down when getting stuck on a problem
- Remember that hard work pays off, even if it isn't always immediately
