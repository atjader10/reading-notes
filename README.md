### Growth Mindset

*To me, growth mindset is about being able to take a step back and find a different perspective in order to see challenges as exciting opportunities to learn.*

1. Lean on teammates to find the best opportunities for collaboration
2. Don't get too down when getting stuck on a problem
3. Remember that hard work pays off, even if it isn't always immediately
