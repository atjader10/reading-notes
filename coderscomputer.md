# Choosing A Text Editor
- there are many different text editors to choose from
- at the end of the day, the decision will mostly come down to personal preference
- if you enjoy using a text editor, that is the best confirmation that it is the one for you
## What is a text editor?
- an important tool used to write and manage text that you will use to build a website
- author's opinion on important features to look out for:
  - code completion
    - suggested results based on what you start typing
    - automatic closing of tags
    - presence of shorthand language - Emmet
  - syntax highlighting
    - adds color to the text you've typed
    - different colors for different categories (i.e. elements, attributes, etc.)
  - variety of themes
    - change background color, text color
  - ability to choose extensions
    - adds extra powers of your choosing to your text editor
## Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer
- every computer will come set up with an existing text editor
  - most of this pre-set programs won't have a lot of features that you will find very helpful
- notes about using text editors that come on your computer
  - make sure it uses plain text (no formatting will be visible or available)
  - create a separate folder to save all of your website coding in and maintain a solid folder structure
  - ensure that you're using the correct extension when saving file names (i.e. .html or .css)

# Cheat Sheet: Basic Terminal Usage
## The Command Line!
### Introduction
- Linux has a graphical user interface
- command line = terminal
- example: have three terminals open while working
  - 1 for working
  - 1 for bringing up ancilliary data
  - 1 for viewing manual pages
### What Are They
- displays a prompt to which you can type commands
- **Line 1**: prompt, then command, then command line arguments (separated by spaces), and options (listed before other arguments and start with '-')
- **Line 2**: output from the command typed in Line 1 (output will sometimes have a display line, sometimes not)
- **Lines after output**: will display prompt again and can run new command
### Opening a Terminal
- different ways to open a terminal depending on OS (mine is Windows Search > Windows Terminal > Ubuntu)
### The Shell, Bash
- the shell determins how the terminal will behave and executes the commands you enter
- Bash = Bourne again shell
- can use the 'echo' command to determine which shell you are using
### Shortcuts
- can use the up and down keys to see previous commands
## Basic Navigation
### Where are we?
- pwd = print working directory
  - tells you where you are
- ls = list
  - what is here
  - can be run optionally with [options] and [location]
### Paths
- path = means to get to a file or directory within the system
- root = top of the hierarchy
- absolute = location in relation to root directory, start with /
- relative = location in relation to where you are now, do not start with /
