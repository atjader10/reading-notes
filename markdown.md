This is where I will put my reading notes for markdown. 

**Summary:** Markdown is a simple tool that you can use to style text on GitHub. This article will teach you how to use Markdown formatting to make updates and style choices. 

## Mastering Markdown on GitHub
### Section 1: What is Markdown?
- a way to style text
- decided by the user
- Markdown uses different characters to signify different formatting options
- can be used in most areas in GitHub
### Examples:
- text
- lists
- images
- headers & quotes
- code
- extras

### Section 2: Syntax Guide
- Headers use "#"
- Emphasis uses "*" 
- Lists use "* "
- Ordered uses numbers
- Images use "!"
- Links use "[]" and "()"
- Blockquotes use ">"
- Inline code uses "'"
### GitHub Flavored Markdown
- GitHub has special, exclusive features for Markdown
- these may only be available in certain areas of GitHub
#### Syntax Highlighting
- you can use "'''" or indent a code line by four spaces
#### Task Lists
- you can use "[]" or "[x]" to show checked or unchecked text boxes to keep track of your to-do items
#### Tables
- you can use "-" and "|" inbetween words to create a table
#### SHA References
- if you reference an SHA-1 hash, GitHub will automatically convert it to a link 
#### Issue references within a repository
- if  you use a number that corresponds to an issue, it will automatically become a link to that issue
#### Username @mentions
- you can mention someone by typing an "@" in front of their username
- this will send them a notification to the location you tagged them
#### Automatic linking for URLs
- anyting typed following a URL format (i.e. "http://www.github.com/") will become a link you can click on that will take to that webpage
#### Strikethrough
- you can use "~ ~" (without the space) to create text that has a line through it
#### Emoji
