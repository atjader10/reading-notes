# HTML Basics
- HTML = hypertext markup language
- used to create the content of webpages
## So what is HTML?
- language made up of elements enclosed in tags
    - the tags are what makes things look different
    - an element is made up of an opening tag, content, and closing tag
    - elements can also have attributes - don't appear in acutal content, but have more info
        - need a space between attribute and element name
        - equal sign
        - inside quotation marks
- elements can be contained inside others
- empty elements don't need closing tags
## Images
- src attribute points to where the image is
- can decide on alternative dipslay text if someone is unable to see the image or the image isn't displaying on the page properly
## Marking up text
- headings: can choose from 6 heading types
- paragraphs: text will be on its own line
- lists: unordered or ordered
## Links
- a = anchor
- href tag for attribute

# Semantics
- semantics - meaning of a piece of code
- there are multiple ways for something to look the same way, but one way might have more benefits or automation than another
- easier to understand the written code as well
