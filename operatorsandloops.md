# Expressions and Operators
- different types of operators:
    - assignment
    - comparison: compares operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true
    - arithmetic: takes numerical values and returns just a single numerical value
    - bitwise: treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), instead of returning a decimal, hexadecimal, or octal number
        - shift operators: first number to be shifted, then the number of positions the first one needs to be shifted
    - logical: usually used with Boolean values 
    - string: concatenates string values together
    - conditional (ternary): if fist condition is true, then it returns the second operand, else the third operand
    - comma: evaluates both operands and returns the last one
    - unary
        - delete: removes an object's property
        - typeof: returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand
        - void: highlights an expression to be evaluated without returning a value
    - relational
        - in: returns true if the specified property is in the specified object
        - instanceof: returns true if the specified object is of the specified object type
- expressions: an valid unit of code that resolves to a value
    - with side effects (assign value to a variable)
    - evaluate and therefore resolved to a value
    - categories:
        - arithmetic: evluates to a number
        - string: evaluates to a character string
        - logical: evaluates to true or false
        - primary expressions: basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript
            - this: refers to a current object
            - grouping operator: controls the precedence of evaluation in expressions using ()
        - left-hand-side expressions: left values are the destination of an assignment
            - new: create an instance of a user-defined object type
            - super: call functions on an object's parents

# Loops and iteration
-  repeat an action a certain number of times
- for statement
    - repeats until the specified condition returns false
    - an expression is run and conditionExpression evaluated
        - if true, loop statement runs
        - if false, loop stops
        - if no conditionExpression, assumes true
    - statement executed
    - returns to conditionExpression evaluation
- while statement
    - executes a statement as long as a specified condition is true
- labeled: identifies a statement
- break: terminate a loop
- continue: restart a statement
